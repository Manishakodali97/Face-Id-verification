# Face-Id-verification
Machine Learning project to recognise people from an Image just like facebook.

Built with the help of dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x

Numpy

Scipy

Scikit-learn

dlib

Tip: Installing dlib can be a tedious job. On macOS or Linux you may follow this link.

Extras:

OpenCV (required only in webcam.py for capturing frames from the webcam)

create_face.py to collect the face data
train face recogniser model and then test with the live webcam inference
